<b>1. How long did you spend on the coding assignment? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.</b>
<br>
Ans:- I did coding for 2 hours to develop all the components and then perform functionality on it for given task. If I have more time I will take latitude and longitude from the API and display marker on Google Map for better understanding of location for user using Goggle Map API. I can add Images as well to display along with information for perticular restaurant. 

<b>2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.</b>
<br>
Ans:- In latest relaese of React, they improve performnace of ReactDOM and I used ReactDOM to create virtual DOM of my projects and divide my code in small components to easily refactor or change it in future. I do not have any code snippet for that but you can check my project hierarchy to check component structure.

<b>3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?</b>
<br>
Ans: I will check performance issue by doing testing and other activities like check code which is written and its quality, check response time of server for the project, check network traffic and bandwidth usage to access resources. I had to use testing in my capstone project to check response rate of developed project.

<b>4. How would you improve the API that you just used?</b>
<br>
Ans:- In this API, they don't have information about rating,Cuisine types and reviews from customers. I can improve that by adding more information to API and used it to disply that in web application for more convenience.
